So professional, so much enthusiasm from the community. You managed to bring the vibe of Google I/O to Ukraine.\" - David Vávra, DevFest '16 Speaker  ## What are we looking for?  We're looking for **experience-based talks**, the information that can not be found in the documentation or easily googled. We're looking for your stories, your struggles, research results and experiences with the frontier tools or technologies. Check the [list of topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eGvBr6wdlXsfiZM4EK6SubfL3G1RWj-ABTBN9pngNg/edit?usp=sharing) we're interested in (it is not full and updated all the time).  ### Format  You can submit as many talks as you want. This year we accept submissions in two formats:   - 40 minutes sessions.   - 2(or 3) hours workshops.  ### Talks that will not pass initial review  - Talks about a specific tool/library/project explaining how it works or how to use it.  - Talks whose focus is pitching a company or project. It’s cool that you mention your company during the presentation, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the talk.  - Proposals that are not in English.  - Recruitment talks to attract talent.  We strongly recommend you check out [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) website from Zach Holman. It includes good tips and guidelines for speakers.   ## Timeline  **Call for Papers submission deadline is July 1, 2017.** Submission results will be announced by July 16.   Any questions?

            "content": "Ukrainian city of Lviv is no doubt one of the most charming and yet not well-known parts of Ukraine. It’s been recently gaining plenty of attention from the world, and was proudly featured on [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video) and [EuroNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video). City’s impressive architecture, absense of large tourist crowds and unique combination of rustiness and timelessness bring out a very special charm, capturing the hearts of everyone who’s ever visited it.  For the perfect vacation in Lviv, check out our extensive compiled selection of top things to do in Lviv!  ## Walk around Rynok Square  UNESCO-listed Rynok Square is one of the top attractions in the city! Your first stop in Lviv will inevitably lead you to the heart of the city – Rynok Square, that can be translated as Market Square. For the past 500 years it has been the bustling center of city life and till now retains all the charm of the old European city, without the pretentions of its more famous neighbors – Prague and Krakow. **Where to find:** in the very city center, hard to miss! **When to visit:** any time **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Climb City Town Hall <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv2.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  How about spending 15 min counting up all the steps in Lviv Town Hall? Getting to its top is one of the most fun things to do in Lviv! We won’t break the secret to you, but will hint that the staircase has more than 300, but less than 500 steps. As they wind up to the tiny round tube at the top of the tower, the counting is even more interesting! **Where to find:** right in the middle of the Market Square (hard to miss!) **When to visit:** Tuesday – Friday from 10 am till 5 pm, Saturday – Sunday from 11 am till 7 pm. It is closed on Mondays. **How much to pay:** 5 UAH, which is 0.5 EURO  ## Take a photo with Neptun <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv3.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Even though Lviv Rynok Square has a total of four fountains at each side – Diana, Neptune, Adonise and Amphitrite, local Lviv residents give their special love to Neptune. ‘Where shall we meet?’ – ‘At Neptune!’ is a typical phrase in conversations of Lviv university students.  **Where to find:** at the Rynok Square, hard to miss! **When to visit:** anytime of the year **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Choose your favorite coffee in Svit Kavy <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv4.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  If you are looking for locals’ all-favorite place to sit around and watch the life pass by, go straight to the charming little coffee shop right opposite to the Boim’s Chapel and Latin Cathedral. Svit Kavy or the World of Coffee is famous for its beautiful interior, lovely summer terrace and, of course, more than 30 varieties of coffee to taste! Deliciously brewed, it will take you to the core of what Lviv is all about. **Where to find:** Katedral’na Sq. 6, between Amadeus Restaurant and Cafe1.  Svit Kavy also has a souvenir-shop that sells coffee-themed souvenirs and coffee beans; look for it to the left of the café’s main entrance **When to visit:** Mon – Fri: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sat, Sun: 9 a.m. – 11 p.m. The best time is the end of September during traditional Coffee Festival **How much to pay:** starting from 3 EURO and up  ## Buy handmade chocolate at the Lviv Chocolate Workshop <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv5.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  No one has the heart to pass by this tiny shop and its large glass window, stocked with rows of delicious tempting chocolate.  Right off the Rynok square, it’s a must visit place for anyone with sweet tooth. Or – what the heck – simply anyone! While first floor hosts a lovely cafe, the biggest attraction of the place – the chocolate shop – is up the narrow winding stairs. The shop features plenty of chocolate souvenirs – truffles, bars and figures of famous buildings. All the chocolate is handmade, straight from the factory, and packaged in beautiful wrapping. One perfect souvenir from Lviv! **Where to find:** Serbska st., 3 **When to visit:** Anytime of the year, 9 a.m. – 23.00. However, best time for chocolate tasting is during city’s Chocolate Festival (first week of February) **How much to pay:** 5-10 EURO at a coffee shop, 10-15 EURO at the gift shop (credit cards are accepted only at the gift shop)  ## Enjoy performances at Lviv Opera Theater <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv6.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Much can be written about this most famous Lviv landmark. Known as the Grand Theater originally, it is now formally called The Lviv National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet of Solomiya Krushelnyts’ka, in honor of Ukraine’s most well-known female opera singer. The Lviv Opera House was built in 1900 using forms of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. The result is one of the most beautiful opera houses in Europe with a luxurious interior, including the Mirror Hall and Parnassus Curtain and a stunning facade with ornate sculpture work. **Where to find:** Svobody ave., 28 **When to visit:** 11 am – 7 pm, tours are available starting from 5 pm.

Why disappointment? Because despite its promising name, the place is not that high (unless 413 m is impressive for you) and has no castle whatsoever. Why surprise? Because it offers a quiet refuge from the busy city streets, and it has indubitably the best aerial views of the city! The hill, also known as Vysoky Zamok, used to be a wooden fortress, built in the 13th century by King Lev.  **Where to find:** High Castle (Vysokyi Zamok) is located just outside Lviv’s center inside Vysokyi Zamok Park. There are no direct transport links to the park, so wear good shoes and  enjoy the 15-20-minute walk from the center.  Just follow the small brown signs. **When to visit:** sunny weather is the best for great bird view of the city **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Explore Lviv underground labyrinths <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv8.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Would you like to check out the 18th century sarcophagus made from a solid stone? Its cover weighs over 600 kg. The object itself is taken apart, but the nature of wreckage indicates that sarcophagus was broken not from the outside, but …from the inside! Eerie, isn’t it? To hear the full Black Monk legend, head to the catacombs of St. Peter and Paul Cathedral of Jesuit Order.   **Where to find:** [Contact](www.activeukraine.com/contact-us/) to arrange for an underground tour of Lviv **When to visit:** any time in the day **How much to pay:** depending on your group size  ## Explore the weaponry collection at Lviv History Museum ‘Arsenal’ <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv9.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Unquestionably, the biggest attraction for any male traveler in Lviv! Museum boasts thousands of weaponry items from more than 30 countries and as old as 10th century. Knives, daggers, swords, sabers, épées, yatagans, axes, halberds, maces, czekans, pernaches, and many other strange names of cold, fire and defensive weapons that will keep your interest throughout all the exhibit. The collection’s highlight is Eastern type sword from the 17th century with double blade, the so-called “Zulfakar”. **Where to find:** Pidvalna st., 5 – close to the town center **When to visit:** daily 10:00 – 17:30, except Wednesdays **How much to pay:** less than 1 EURO, extra fee is charged for photo and video footage  These and a lot of others impressive things you can do and see in Lviv!!!

I don’t know about you, but I know many that spent hours trying to press those specific sequences of red, green, blue and yellow buttons in the correct order. But why play on your own? We’ve implemented a gRPC server that allows you to play Simon with other players over the internet!\n\nIn this workshop we will dive into the toolset and libraries to build your very own Simon Says client for this server. We will have a message description in Protocol Buffers format and some stub code in several languages ready for you to play with. The goal for this workshop is for you to have a working client that you can use to play (and beat!) other attendees of the workshop.",
